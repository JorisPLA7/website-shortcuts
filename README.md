# Website Shortcut

Browser extension to add an unique keyboard shortcut to open some webpage elements, like the searchbar or the login page/form.

## Store links 

* [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/website-shortcuts/)
* [Chome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/website-shortcuts/pgenobamflicdajiblcdjpfendgpcijg) very much outdated until Google validates the new update)

Default shortcuts for PC : Windows, Linux
- `Ctrl + Space` to open the searchbar
- `Ctrl + Shift + Y` to open the homepage

Default shortcuts for Mac
- `Ctrl + Space` to open the searchbar
- `Ctrl + H` to open the homepage

Feel free to change them in your browser settings.

## New features

- Nice UI
- Customizable shortcuts from the browser settings

## Kind of a roadmap : 

Very next steps :

- Update the Firefox release to the latest version with customisable shortcuts

Features I would like to add :

- Support localized homepages such as `https://www.example.com/fr/` or `https://www.example.com/en/`
- `Ctrl + L` to open the login page/form
- Verify command registered on action popup load : `https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/commands/#verify-commands-registered`
- Enable focus search bars hidden behind a menu button.
- Make it work with login forms hidden behind a login button.
- Fix existing searbar border destruction when the extension is turned off
